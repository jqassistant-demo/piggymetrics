=== Naming Rules

This section describes the naming rules that apply for the project.

[[naming:TypeMustBeLocatedInPackageContainingArtifactId]]
[source,cypher,role=constraint]
.Every Java type must be located within a package with the name `com.piggymetrics.<serviceId>` where serviceId is the artifactId of the containing Maven module without the trailing "_service" suffix.
----
MATCH
  (artifact:Maven:Artifact)
WITH
  artifact, "com.piggymetrics." + replace(artifact.name,"-service","") as expectedPackage
MATCH
  (artifact)-[:CONTAINS]->(type:Type)
WHERE NOT
  type.fqn starts with expectedPackage
RETURN
  type as Type, expectedPackage as `Expected Package`
ORDER BY
  type.fqn
----

[[naming:SpringServicesMustBeLocatedInServicePackage]]
[source,cypher,role=constraint,requiresConcepts="spring-component:Service"]
.Spring services (i.e. classes annotated with @Service) must be located in "service" packages.
----
MATCH
  (package:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(service:Spring:Service)
WHERE
  package.name <> "service"
RETURN
  service as Service
----

=== Reports

This section provides reports about the project structure.

[[report:ComponentDependency]]
[source,cypher,role=concept,requiresConcepts="spring-component:Component,java:VirtualDependsOn",reportType="plantuml-component-diagram"]
.Spring Injectables and their dependencies, grouped by service.
----
MATCH
  (artifact:Main:Artifact)-[:CONTAINS]->(injectable:Spring:Injectable)
OPTIONAL MATCH
  (injectable)-[dependsOn:DEPENDS_ON|VIRTUAL_DEPENDS_ON]->(:Spring:Injectable)
RETURN
  {
    role: "graph",
    parent: artifact,
    nodes: collect(injectable),
    relationships: collect(dependsOn)
  }
